# Website working group
This is the repo where we manage all of our work related to the omigroup website working group and omigroup.org website. 

## How to get involved? 
The website working group meets every 2 weeks on Tuesdays from 23:00 UTC - 00:00 UTC (6:00pm EST). To get involved, please visit [the website discussions page](https://github.com/omigroup/website/discussions) and the [website group projects backlog](https://github.com/omigroup/website/projects/1). 

We use Milestones to batch our work around core objectives. You can see our [Website Milestones here](https://github.com/omigroup/website/milestones)

There are a number of people who contribute to this working group. We give what we can, when we can. If you are looking to make contact with someone who is part of this group, please reach out to Shadow or Echoparadigm on OMI Discord. We also communicate in the website channel on OMI Discord.

Do you see an opportunity to improve this repo? Please submit a PR. 

## Core objectives today: 

- Complete the new version of our website 
- Assess the style guide for accessibility 
- Source content, such as images of exploring the Metaverse, to add to our website. 

## Does this group have a working agreement? 

No, this group has not yet created a working agreement. Once there are more people participating consistently, the group will select an appropriate time to meet, and establish a working agreement (when we meet, how we will respect each other, how we will give feedback in retros, what tools we use, etc.)
